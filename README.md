## Overview
this was a fun one, im probably trying to dive into too many elements to start out but i am enjoying taking my time and learning different ways to do things and more universal elements rather than hardcoding certain things.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
so for my 2nd project i tried to structure it more. so i thought about all the elements i needed, i got the basic html layout of the whole page then moved into styling. this sounds pretty straight forward structure but its a big step for me and my adhd ways of thinking about the style of something before i know how/why/where to correctly use it. then with css just really focused on 1 element until it was right before moving onto the next, or if i struggled i would realize im going nowhere so id take 5 from that element and move onto another. this though i found i would break things with code i doubled up or didnt delete. all in all happy witgh progress and excited for the next.


### What I learned

i learnt how to correctly use flex box, ive had a look at more pseudo commands but ill need more practice.
